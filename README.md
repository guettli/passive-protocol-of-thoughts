# Passive protocol of thoughts

The "passive protocol of thoughts" is method to achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.

I found this method for myself, but I guess similar methods are well known since ages. It is a mixture of meditation and writing a diary.

1. Be sure to have roughly 5 to 15 minutes without being disturbed. Make your phone silent. Try to be in a silent environment. Switch of noice production things like a radio.
1. Set an alarm clock. How long? It's your choice. If unsure use 12 minutes.
1. Take a sheet of paper and a pen or an other (maybe digitial) device to be able to take notes.
1. Sit down. You should feel comfortable.
1. Maybe listen to some very calm and slow music
1. Close your eyes.
1. Watch your breath.
1. Do not change the way you breath. Let your breath flow like the breath wants to go.
1. Maybe your lunge wants to do [Diaphragmatic_breathing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragmatic_breathing). Maybe not. It does not matter.
1. If you want to, you can count the number of breaths you do.
1. If you want to, you can change your pose after ten breaths.
1. It won't take long and you will start to think about something. This can be anything, something from the future, something about the past.
1. Write down this thought. 
1. Don't judge your thought. It is neither good nor bad. It comes and it goes again.
1. Watch your breath again. If you want to you can count the number of breaths
1. The next thought will come. Take a note. Let it come, let it go.
1. If you are new to medition, you should not do this longer then 15 minutes.
1. Instead of doing it once a week four two hours, I think it is better to do it daily for ten minutes.

It is likely that you get a thought like "Oh, I forget xyz. I need to this now". Then please keep on sitting. Just highlight this note somehow. This way you can do this important thing after the passive protocol of thoughts is finished.

During this method I often thing about things which I want to do in the next days. If there is something which is related to my work, then I write myself a mail to my address at work. If there is something I want to do in my sparetime, then I write myself to my personal email address. This is abit tricky. Don't get lost read messages. Just write the message, and then stop. Close your eyes again and watch your breath.
