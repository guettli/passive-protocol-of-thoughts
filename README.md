# Passive protocol of thoughts

The "passive protocol of thoughts" is meditation method to achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.

I found this method for myself, but I guess similar methods are well known since ages. It is a mixture of meditation and writing a diary.

1. Be sure to have roughly 5 to 15 minutes without being disturbed. Make your phone silent. Try to be in a silent environment. Switch of noice production things like a radio. Using IT terms: No input.
1. Set an alarm clock. How long? It's your choice. If unsure use 12 minutes.
1. Take a sheet of paper and a pen or an other (maybe digitial) device to be able to take notes.
1. Sit down. You should feel comfortable.
1. Maybe listen to some very calm and slow music
1. Close your eyes.
1. Watch your breath.
1. Do not change the way you breath. Let your breath flow like the breath wants to go.
1. Maybe your lunge wants to do [Diaphragmatic_breathing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragmatic_breathing). Maybe not. It does not matter.
1. If you want to, you can count the number of breaths you do.
1. If you want to, you can change your pose after ten breaths.
1. It won't take long and you will start to think about something. This can be anything, something from the future, something about the past. Be passive. Let it come.
1. Write down this thought. 
1. Don't judge your thought. It is neither good nor bad. It comes and it goes again.
1. Close your eyes and watch your breath again. If you want to you can count the number of breaths again.
1. The next thought will come. Take a note. Let it come, let it go.
1. Do this until the alarm clock rings


If you are new to medition, you should not do this longer then 15 minutes. Sometimes there are many thoughts, sometimes only view.

If you want to, archive these notes in a secret place. Or if you want to, burn them. 

In buddism these sometimes "crazy" thoughts are called [Monkey mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_mind). I like the term, but not more. I am not a buddist. I don't know all these foreign words of this wikipedia page.

Sometime I feel [Ambivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambivalence). This method helps me to achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm and stable state.


Instead of doing it once a week four two hours, I think it is better to do it daily for ten minutes.

It is likely that you get a thought like "Oh, I forget xyz. I need to this now". Then please keep on sitting. Just highlight this note somehow. This way you can do this important thing after the passive protocol of thoughts is finished.

During this method I often think about things which I want to do in the next days. If there is something which is related to my work, then I write myself a mail to my address at work. If there is something I want to do in my sparetime, then I write myself to my personal email address. This is a bit tricky. The digital device could create unwanted input. Don't get lost read messages. Just write the message, and then stop. Close your eyes again and watch your breath.

I meditate a bit in the age of 17. When I was 35 I started to practice Yoga daily. When I was 40 I started to write a diary.

I was inspired by [Yuval Noah Harari's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari) chapter about meditation in his book [21 Lessons for the 21st Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Lessons_for_the_21st_Century).

# What's it not

I avoid any kind of esotericism. I believe in science. There is no magic.

It is not writing a diary. If you write a diary you are not passive. If you do the passive protocol of thoughts, you just take a short note. These notes usualy don't make sense to someone else. If you write a diary you tell a story, the second sentence referes to the first sentence. The ppot is different: It is likely that the second note does not relate to the first note at all.

# Feedback is welcome

I am not a native speaker. If there is something not clear, then please write me (guettli.ppot@thomas-guettler.de) or create an issue here at github. Please tell me typos or anything else which could be improved.

If you know a method which is similar to this method, then please tell me! I am curious and always interested in new stuff.
